                  Beryl Cook is one of Britain’s most talented and amusing
                  artists .Beryl’s pictures feature women of all shapes and
                  sizes enjoying themselves .Born between the two world wars,
                  Beryl Cook eventually left Kendrick School in Reading at the
                  age of 15, where she went to secretarial school and then into
                  an insurance office. After moving to London and then Hampton,
                  she eventually married her next door neighbour from Reading,
                  John Cook. He was an officer in the Merchant Navy and after he
                  left the sea in 1956, they bought a pub for a year before John
                  took a job in Southern Rhodesia with a motor company. Beryl
                  bought their young son a box of watercolours, and when showing
                  him how to use it, she decided that she herself quite enjoyed
                  painting. John subsequently bought her a child’s painting set
                  for her birthday and it was with this that she produced her
                  first significant work, a half-length portrait of a
                  dark-skinned lady with a vacant expression and large drooping
                  breasts. It was aptly named ‘Hangover’ by Beryl’s husband and

                  It is often frustrating to attempt to plan meals that are
                  designed for one. Despite this fact, we are seeing more and
                  more recipe books and Internet websites that are dedicated to
                  the act of cooking for one. Divorce and the death of spouses
                  or grown children leaving for college are all reasons that
                  someone accustomed to cooking for more than one would suddenly
                  need to learn how to adjust all the cooking practices utilized
                  before into a streamlined plan of cooking that is more
                  efficient for one person creating less.

                  It is often frustrating to attempt to plan meals that are
                  designed for one. Despite this fact, we are seeing more and
                  more recipe books and Internet websites that are dedicated to
                  the act of cooking for one. Divorce and the death of spouses
                  or grown children leaving for college are all reasons that
                  someone accustomed to cooking for more than one would suddenly
                  need to learn how to adjust all the cooking practices utilized
                  before into a streamlined plan of cooking that is more
                  efficient for one person creating less.

                  Beryl Cook is one of Britain’s most talented and amusing
                  artists .Beryl’s pictures feature women of all shapes and
                  sizes enjoying themselves .Born between the two world wars,
                  Beryl Cook eventually left Kendrick School in Reading at the
                  age of 15, where she went to secretarial school and then into
                  an insurance office. After moving to London and then Hampton,
                  she eventually married her next door neighbour from Reading,
                  John Cook. He was an officer in the Merchant Navy and after he
                  left the sea in 1956, they bought a pub for a year before John
                  took a job in Southern Rhodesia with a motor company. Beryl
                  bought their young son a box of watercolours, and when showing
                  him how to use it, she decided that she herself quite enjoyed
                  painting. John subsequently bought her a child’s painting set
                  for her birthday and it was with this that she produced her
                  first significant work, a half-length portrait of a
                  dark-skinned lady with a vacant expression and large drooping
                  breasts. It was aptly named ‘Hangover’ by Beryl’s husband and
